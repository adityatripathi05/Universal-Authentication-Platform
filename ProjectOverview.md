# Universal Authentication Platform (UAP)
## Project Vision Document

---

## Project Overview

### Project Name
**Universal Authentication Platform (UAP)**

### Executive Summary
The Universal Authentication Platform (UAP) is a lightweight, API-driven authentication microservice designed to eliminate the need for organizations to develop authentication code from scratch. UAP integrates into existing application stacks as a dedicated authentication service, requiring only that the host application expose a secure API for credential validation. UAP orchestrates the entire authentication process—including security middleware, MFA, and session management—while the host application retains full control over its user data and business logic.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
Modern software development faces several authentication-related challenges:

- **Authentication Fragmentation**: In an organization, each application implements its own authentication system, leading to code duplication and inconsistent security practices
- **Authentication Implementation Complexity**: Building secure authentication from scratch requires deep security expertise and significant development time
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Most authentication solutions require complete data migration or system overhaul
- **Security Complexity**: Implementing secure authentication requires deep expertise in cryptography, security protocols, and compliance standards
- **Security Vulnerability Risks**: Custom authentication implementations often contain security flaws due to lack of specialized expertise
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: In an organization, when a applications need to support various authentication methods (OAuth 2.0, SAML, JWT, MFA, SSO) it increases development complexity
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Authentication systems require constant security updates, patches, and monitoring
- **Multi-Tenant Complexity**: Supporting multi-tenant applications with proper data isolation is challenging
- **Microservice Integration**: Coordinating authentication across multiple microservices adds complexity
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meeting industry standards w.r.t security requires specialized knowledge and ongoing effort
- **Development Resource Allocation**: Teams spend valuable time on authentication instead of core business features

### Impact of Current State
- Increased development time and costs for authentication implementation
- Security vulnerabilities due to inexperienced or inconsistent custom implementations
- Data migration complexity when adopting new authentication systems
- Compliance risks and audit failures
- Operational overhead in maintaining authentication infrastructure
- Delayed product launches due to authentication development bottlenecks

## Solution Overview

### High-Level Solution
The Universal Authentication Platform provides a microservice-based authentication solution that:

- **Serves as a Dedicated Authentication Microservice**: Integrates into any organization's application stack to handle authentication logic
- **Requires Minimal Prerequisites**: Only needs a secure API endpoint from the host application to validate user credentials.
- **Offers Configuration-Driven Integration**: Host applications specify authentication type, fields (username/email/custom), and session requirements
- **Provides Complete Authentication APIs**: Host applications use UAP's APIs to authenticate users and manage sessions
- **Supports Multiple Authentication Schemes**: Provides out-of-the-box support for various authentication strategies, including Basic Auth, JWT, and OAuth 2.0 flows, which UAP orchestrates.
- **Enables Role-Based Session Management**: Configurable session expiry based on user roles and device policies
- **Includes Optional Security Middleware**: CAPTCHA, SMS verification, and MFA as add-on layers based on requirements
- **Maintains Zero Business Logic**: Focuses purely on authentication while host handles user management and permissions

### Core Value Proposition
"Offload your entire authentication workload. Choose from a variety of authentication schemes like OAuth 2.0, JWT, and more. You provide a simple API for credential validation; UAP handles the complete, complex authentication flow, including security middleware, MFA, session management, and audit logging."

---

## Integration Prerequisites

> Host-Provided Credential Validation API (Service-to-Service Security)
> The host must expose a small, secure API that UAP calls to validate primary credentials (or fetch minimal user metadata). This API must be protected for machine-to-machine access (e.g., API key, mTLS, private networking/IP allow-list, or short-lived tokens via client credentials). This is not end-user authentication—UAP owns the end-user authentication experience (flows, middleware, MFA, sessions, tokens, audit). The host only ensures that only UAP can call the validation endpoint and retains full data ownership without sharing database credentials.

### Host Application Requirements
To integrate UAP, your application must expose a secure API endpoint that UAP can call to validate user credentials. This API-only approach ensures your user data and database credentials are never exposed to UAP, providing maximum security and data privacy.

#### 1. **Host-Provided Authentication API**
You provide a secure API endpoint that UAP calls to validate a user's credentials.
- **Endpoint URL**: The URL for your credential validation endpoint.
- **API Credentials**: A secure token (e.g., API Key, OAuth token) for UAP to authenticate itself to your API. This is for **service-to-service authentication** to ensure only UAP can call your validation endpoint; it is not end-user authentication.
- **Request/Response Schema**: A clearly defined contract for how UAP will send credentials and what it expects in return (e.g., `{"success": true, "user_id": "123"}`).

#### 2. **(Optional) Host-Provided User Info API**
If you want UAP to enforce role-based session policies, you can provide an optional endpoint for retrieving user details or roles.
- **Endpoint URL**: The URL for your user information endpoint.
- **API Credentials**: Secure token for authentication.

#### 2. **Authentication Scheme Configuration**
You configure UAP to use the authentication scheme that best fits your needs. UAP manages the entire flow for the chosen scheme.
- **Scheme Selection**: Choose from a variety of industry-standard authentication schemes provided by UAP, such as OAuth 2.0 (all major flows), JWT-based authentication, Active Directory (AD), LDAP, or traditional session-based flows.
- **Scheme-Specific Parameters**: Provide the necessary configuration for the chosen scheme (e.g., OAuth client IDs, token signing keys, redirect URIs).
- **Password Policy**: While your application validates the password, UAP's security model assumes you are using modern, strong hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).

#### 3. **Session Management Requirements**
- **Session Duration**: Default and maximum session timeouts
- **Role-Based Expiry**: Different session durations for different user roles
- **Device Policy**: Single device login or multiple concurrent sessions
- **Session Storage**: Preferred session storage mechanism

#### 4. **Security Requirements**
- **Middleware Selection**: Which optional security layers you need
  - CAPTCHA integration
  - SMS verification
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Custom security middleware
- **Rate Limiting**: Authentication attempt limits
- **Account Lockout**: Failed attempt policies

### Integration Process Overview
1. **Expose Your API**: Create a secure endpoint in your application for credential validation.
2. **Configure UAP**: Provide the endpoint URL and API credentials to UAP via its configuration API.
3. **Integrate UAP APIs**: Use UAP's `/authenticate` and `/validate` APIs in your application's login and session-checking logic.
4. **Configure Middleware**: Add optional security layers like MFA or CAPTCHA through UAP's configuration.
5. **Go Live**: Deploy UAP alongside your application stack.

```

### API Integration Flow
1. **User Login Request**: The user submits their credentials to your application's frontend.
2. **Backend Request to UAP**: Your application's backend receives the credentials and makes a single API call to UAP's `/authenticate` endpoint.
3. **Pre-Authentication Middleware**: UAP runs pre-authentication checks like rate limiting and CAPTCHA validation.
4. **Credential Validation via Host API**: UAP calls back to your application's secure, pre-configured authentication endpoint to validate the user's credentials. Your application checks the credentials against your database and returns a simple success or failure response.
5. **Post-Authentication Middleware**: If credential validation is successful, UAP runs post-authentication checks, such as triggering an MFA flow.
6. **Session Creation**: UAP generates a secure session token (e.g., JWT).
7. **Response to Backend**: UAP returns the session token and user information to your backend, which can then establish the user's session.

### Key UAP APIs
- `POST /api/v1/authenticate` - Authenticate user credentials
- `GET /api/v1/validate` - Validate session token
- `POST /api/v1/logout` - Terminate user session
- `POST /api/v1/refresh` - Refresh session token
- `PUT /api/v1/config` - Update authentication configuration

2. **Authentication Phase**: Core credential validation
3. **Post-Authentication Phase**: MFA, SMS verification, custom checks
4. **Session Creation Phase**: Token generation, session storage

---

## Security and Compliance

### Securing the Configuration API
The `PUT /api/v1/config` endpoint is a powerful administrative tool. UAP ensures its security through multiple layers:
- **Privileged Access**: Requires a separate, highly-privileged API key, distinct from standard authentication keys.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enforces MFA for any user or system initiating a configuration change.
- **IP Whitelisting**: Access to the configuration API can be restricted to a list of trusted IP addresses.
- **Detailed Audit Logs**: All configuration changes are logged with details on who made the change, from where, and when.

### Data Privacy and Compliance
UAP is designed with data privacy as a core principle, helping organizations meet their compliance obligations.
- **Data Minimization**: UAP only processes the data essential for authentication and session management, and does not persist sensitive user information.
- **Stateless Architecture**: Beyond session tokens and audit logs, UAP remains stateless regarding your user data.
- **Compliance Support**: The architecture is designed to be compliant with major data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, with features supporting data residency requirements and user data rights.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
