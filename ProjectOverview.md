## Business Goals / KPIs
- **Security**: Maintain compliance with current market standards of secure authentication, introducing regular audits and security patches.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling millions of authentication requests per day with minimal downtime.
- **Integration**: Achieve seamless integration with at least 90% of existing platforms and technologies used by partner businesses.
- **User Experience**: Enhance the end-user authentication experience, aiming for a satisfaction score of 8/10 or higher in surveys.

This project aims to revolutionize the way authentication is managed, enhancing security and user experience across various platforms.
