## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Universal Authentication Platform (UAP). UAP is designed as a plug-and-play authentication microservice that seamlessly integrates with existing applications without requiring changes to their user management systems.

### 1.2 Scope
The UAP is a lightweight, configurable authentication microservice that connects to existing project databases or APIs to provide secure authentication services. The system focuses on authentication logic while leaving user management, role management, and business logic to the host application.

### 1.3 Core Philosophy
- **Zero Business Logic**: UAP handles only authentication, not user or role management
- **Seamless Integration**: Plug-and-play with existing project architectures
- **Configuration-Driven**: Adapt to any project through configuration
- **Middleware Approach**: Additional security features as optional middleware layers

### 1.4 Definitions and Acronyms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| UAP | Universal Authentication Platform |
| Host Application | The client application that integrates UAP for authentication |
| Configuration Profile | Set of parameters defining how UAP integrates with a host application |
| Authentication Adapter | Component that connects UAP to host application's data source |
| Middleware Layer | Optional security components (MFA, CAPTCHA, etc.) |

---

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture
UAP operates as a packaged library/microservice that integrates directly into a single host application:
- Connects to host application's existing user data (database tables or APIs)
- Provides authentication services within the host application's architecture
- Returns authentication results to host application components
- Maintains minimal session state only for authentication purposes
- Supports host application's multi-tenant architecture if applicable

### 2.2 Integration Model
```
Host Application Components <-> UAP Package <-> Host Application's Data Sources
                                    |              (Database Tables or APIs)
                               Middleware Layers
                           (CAPTCHA, MFA, SMS, etc.)
```

### 2.3 Deployment Model
- **Package Installation**: UAP installed as dependency/package in host application
- **Single Host Application**: One UAP instance per host application
- **Multi-Service Support**: Can communicate with multiple microservices within the same host application
- **Tenant Awareness**: Supports multi-tenant host applications with tenant-aware authentication

### 2.4 Key Principles
- **Data Ownership**: Host application retains full ownership of user data
- **Stateless Design**: UAP doesn't store business data, only authentication state
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adapt to any authentication schema or flow
- **Minimal Footprint**: Lightweight service with minimal resource requirements
